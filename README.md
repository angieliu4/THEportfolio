### Calcuclator (2025)

  Created by Angie Liu on September 25, 2025, this is a fully interactive graphical calculator that features a clean and functional interface with a variety of mathematical operations. It includes all basic operations, and functions such as square root, natural logarithm, absolute value, and exponentiation. Users interact with the calculator by clicking on buttons to input numbers and select operations.
  
  The display dynamically updates to show the current input or output value, adjusting the text size based on length for readability. The calculator supports both unary and binary operations, allows toggling the sign of numbers, and provides an “AC” button to reset all inputs. The layout is visually structured, using color coding to distinguish between different types of buttons, and hover effects are implemented to enhance user experience.
